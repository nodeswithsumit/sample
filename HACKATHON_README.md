# Hackathon Submissions Repository

## Overview
This repository is configured for hackathon team submissions.

## Structure
- Each team gets a dedicated branch (team-1, team-2, etc.)
- Teams can only access their assigned branch
- Main branch is protected for organizer use

## Submission Guidelines
1. Teams will be given access to their specific branch
2. All code and documentation should be committed to the team branch
3. Final submissions will be evaluated from the team branch
4. Do not attempt to access other team branches

## Security
- Branch isolation prevents teams from seeing other submissions
- All activities are logged and monitored
- Automated backups ensure data safety
